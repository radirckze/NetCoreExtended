### Task Parallel Library (TPL) related notes  

### TAP related notes  

* TAP uses a single method to represent the initiation and completion of an asynchronous operation (in contrast to APM and EAP patterns.  
* Generally asynchronous methods in TAP include the Async suffix after the operation name for methods that return awaitable types, for example, GetAsync.  
* TAP methods return TAsks.Task or a Tasks.Task<TResult> depending on whether the corresponding synchronous method returns void a some type.  
  * Exceptions are out an ref parameters that should generally be avoided (but can be added to TResult where necessary).  
* TAP methods can do a small amount of work synchronously, such as validating arguments, which should be kept to a minimum, so the method can return quickly.   
* An asynchronous method should throw an exception only in response to a usage error (e.g., user passes null to a paremeter). Usage errors should never occur in production code. For example, if passing a null reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) as one of the methodâ€™s arguments causes an error state (usually represented by an ArgumentNullException exception), you can modify the calling code to ensure that a null reference is never passed. For all other errors, exceptions that occur when an asynchronous method is running should be assigned to the returned task  
* See Task Status, Cancellation and Progress Reporting. 

**Implementing TAP Pattern**  
You can implement the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) in three ways: by using the compilers in Visual Studio, manually, or a combination of the compiler and manual methods. 

**Workload Best Practices**  
While TAP methods can be used for compute-bound and I/O-bound asynchronous operations, when TAP methods are exposed publicly from a library, they should be provided only for workloads that primarily involve I/O-bound operations. If a method is purely compute-bound, it should be exposed only as a synchronous implementation. The code that consumes it may then choose whether to wrap it in a task to offload the work to another thread.
